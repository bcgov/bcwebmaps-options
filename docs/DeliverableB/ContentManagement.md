#Content Management
Archetype: Content Management

What is it?  A content management system (CMS) is a software application that can be used to manage the creation and modification of digital content. More specific types of CMS might be enterprise content management, web content management, and Digital Asset Management. 
 
What it is not: Project management/tracking maybe seen by some as "content management", and collaboration tools may involve management of content, but neither are content management systems. 

Keywords:  portal, knowledge base, wiki

Examples of Content Management: A CMS typically has two major components: an administrative interface that allows a content owner to add, modify, and remove content, and a delivery mechanism - often seen as "publishing" - that makes the content available to content consumers.  CMS Lite is considered a CMS. The use of Drupal to produce our @Work site, yields a similar type of result, but is not in itself, a CMS.

Preferred Direction:  Define the capability, aggregate the need across the enterprise, recognize high-level use cases, and recommend approaches to address the use cases.  

For discussion: Are we saying here, that an acceptable implementation of this archetype must fully support records management legislation and CIRMO guidance?
