# Find the right solution for your business
There are many options for web mapping technology frameworks in today’s world.  The purpose of this site is to showcase what is available, and if any of these solutions can meet your needs.

The Province of British Columbia currently uses four main web mapping frameworks. These frameworks vary from a cloud-based Software as a Service (SaaS) solution, two Government hosted solutions and Do-It-Yourself solutions. <br>

1. The SaaS solution is the cloud-based ESRI solution commonly known as [AGO](https://bcgov.github.io/bcwebmaps-options/web-mapping-frameworks/ago.html)
        or ArcGIS Online.
2. Two Government hosted service offerings: 
   - Common Web Mapping Framework [CWM](https://bcgov.github.io/bcwebmaps-options/web-mapping-frameworks/cwm.html) which is based on Openlayers 2, and 
   - Internet Mapping Framework [IMF2](https://bcgov.github.io/bcwebmaps-options/web-mapping-frameworks/imf2.html) which is based on 
                VertiGIS’s GeoCortex Essentials.
3. The Simple Map Kit ([SMK](https://bcgov.github.io/bcwebmaps-options/web-mapping-frameworks/smk.html)) is Open Source and can be deployed anywhere.  It is Leaflet.js based and and it can be used to rapidly configure web mapping applications that consume BC Gov-hosted data or uploaded files.  The code is also extensible allowing for customization to meet business and end user needs.
4. Also listed are currently popular open source libaries that provide flexibility and options for development of simple to complex applications. These specific libaries are not hosted or maintained by anyone BC Government Organization, but they have been used (and contributed to) by various project teams within the BC Government to build awesome and business specific solutions. 
See their respective websites (linked below) for more information. Examples of the use of these open source libaries, with the BC Government, are listed in the next section below.  
    - [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) and [React Leaflet](https://react-leaflet.js.org/)
    - [Mapbox GL JS](https://www.mapbox.com/)
    - [MapLibre GL JS](https://maplibre.org/)
    - [Google Maps](https://developers.google.com/maps)

## Costs and Skillsets

Costs can be highly variable and are influenced by multiple factors; 
as such, it is best to first identify the solution that will meet
user needs, then collaborate with DataBC or IIT to arrive at a
mutually agreeable business arrangement.
